In addition, escalators and water fountains always broken, some staff are very rude and impatient when trying to help you out.

Today, the building inaugurated in 2004, is a widely recognizable city landmark. The structure resembling an intergalactic spaceship, is a box, notably elevated from the ground and supported by pillars varying in colors and their angles.
The feat of the modern architectural thought, the Sharp Centre for Design, is the joint work of the famous British architect Will Alsop in partnership with Toronto-based Robbie/Young + Wright Architects. The design received many influential awards and praises of the world architectural and engineering organizations.
Looking to the south, down McCaul St, enjoy the view of the CN Tower.

But hey King's University is a great school for someone that doesn't like being in an overpopulated school.
Honestly, I love how small the classroom sizes are and how free and easy students and lecturers communicate which I think is a key importance in every student's life.

King's University has a very good Christian culture and a plus for someone very interested in Christianity and building a very good Christian-like foundation üòÄ üëç.

As a first-year winter student, it is been okay so far and I think I would like it here üòä.

Wait how do you all make friends in new schools cause I know I am finding it hard making friends here üòÇ no offense tho, but maybe later in the year I would.

There is a lot to say about King's University but I won't say much cause I just started, I must say the students, staff, and workers are soo friendly Honestly it creeps me up sometimes üòÖ coming from a country that cares less about politeness. It pretty welcoming here.

I might add more information or thoughts as time goes on or I might not.

Acadia University,,,,nan,,,ChIJwQtRyp8ioFMRiw7h2IIkM8w,"My experience as a former student of The King's University began as a 4 star experience in the 2021 school year as I found the mandatory courses to be engaging and the professors to be helpful and welcoming. The following school year was a drastic change in which several long-term employees were terminated and were replaced by professors who were inexperienced and lacked the competency to teach at a university level.

In addition, tuition rates were raised by 7.5% on already phenomenally high costs, bringing the cost per course to 1316.00$. The decline in value of education was very sharp. In order to afford these rising costs, I began a full time day job and discovered there were only three evening courses being offered in the entire institution so I had no selection in my courses as I required a minimum of three to maintain full time status. As one course was so poorly taught, I was forced to withdraw for a partial refund so it would not be a complete waste of time and money. Textbooks for courses were additionally strange as they were often Amazon books not available elsewhere and being sold directly by the author. The books gave a singular viewpoint, were not academically credible outside of the institution and were favourable by the professors for the specific narrative they wanted to teach.

I went to the registry to discuss concurrent enrolment to keep my full time status, however Michael Abadilla at the registry informed me that it would not work like that and did not provide any relevant information or assistance otherwise. As a result, my scholarship and grant money was terminated and I later came to find out through an advisor from Alberta Student Aid that concurrent enrolment was an option available to me but unfortunately the lack of staff competency at the registry lead to great financial loss for me.

The value of a degree at this institution holds very little value as a job seeker as there are limited opportunities for growth within the institution and a high degree of leniency to students that does not encourage efforts in class. As a religious institution, the teachings of Christianity were conflicting as the conduct of students did not uphold the supposed values of the institution and the religious teachings and doctrine varied based on the professor. Some held ""conservative"" views while others taught ""liberal"" Christianity and at the end it was confusing and contributed to a loss of faith and lack of understanding regarding  the principles of the religion the institution was trying to teach.

This school is suitable as an entry-way into post-secondary if you hold a GED or lower marks in highschool, or choose to apply as a mature student but it is only good for using the education to quickly transfer to a more credible university.

Overall, this experience was not worth the thousands of dollars wasted, poor teaching and moving hundreds of miles from home for the opportunity to receive a post-secondary education but it served as a stepping stone to receiving a better education elsewhere.",NJNP,2.0,,2023-02-21

They have so many unique and cool programs that the others don't have. What I heard is that it is a  good university if the program you want portrays to what you want.

The location is nice since it is located where Berri-UQAM station is and they have an underground city where you can access some buildings and classes.

The university is pretty similar to Concordia. They both have similar programs, they are both in downtown and have campuses that similar to each other.

From what I heard from others. It is a decent University. The same platform and set up as you guessed it Concordia.

The campus near Place Des arts in a nice touch and close to downtown as well and it feels like a typical college or American University for its design.

The main campus feels a bit old and run downed. They need to renovate as soon as possible and make it 2021 since most of the buildings feel old and not updated enough.

I hope they promote Zero waste, Zero Carbon Emissions, Carbon free and be environmentally sustainable and adaptable to climate change A.S.AP.

The dean and most of the higher ups, teachers are very friendly and they can break their back to help you for your well being instead of being greedy with your money (looking at you, Moncton) which is something that I highly appreciate, my only regret is not choosing this university in the first place instead of wasting my time with one that was mediocre and money hungry.

The reason why I've put 4 stars instead of 5 is because the residences are really old and severly lacking compared to other universities, it almost looks like a summer camp, it doesn't help the residence managers are kind of sticklers and any program that you have to go through Laurentian University to take online classes from personal experiences I would not recommend it and instead if you're a French student I would rather go in Qu√©bec, LU doesn't give two craps about your well being and education though thanks to Sainte-Anne they'll do their best to assist you if something goes wrong but I was put through hell when I've dealt with them and online classes are boring as hell (not via TEAM), it doesn't help that LU's portal is from the 1990's and it would probably be easier to surf on the dark web than their system plus good luck if someone (at LU) help you to register your class and god bless you if your professor does care if you reach out to them.

Other than this negative comment I'm a 100% happy with Sainte-Anne and the higher ups are amazing so for me all of this evens out with the cons, the food at the cafeteria is also good (though some people complain about it but it's a cafeteria you shouldn't expect the same level as a steakhouse or high end restaurant, it was the same at Moncton), I would definitely and happily recommend this University !! üòÑ",Coast Guy506,4.0,,2023-09-03

There was no consistency in semesters, 10 sessions after we started the semester, new students were added to the class and the teacher had to start teaching from the beginning and we wasted couple of sessions just to review the content for the new student to catch up. 2 days after that another student were added to the class, same thing going on all the semester. you didn't value our time!  there was no structure for semesters either, we didn't know how many sessions are in one semester, how long is it, when is the final exam, no written test or proper evaluation. it was unprofessional. evaluation was based on teacher likes and desires.

I am, however, very disappointed by the lack of accountability by the staff to assist  students. Rarely did I ever have my questions answered and when they were, it was to say what I already knew. Every time I spoke to someone for assistance in finding the right program for me, I was brushed off and sent to another person that would do the exact same thing. I would then be asked to do everything online. I would have no problem doing things online if they did not use very old systems that do not work, or that will work on a on and off basis. This could easily be fixed if they did not force students to have to do everything on their old websites and would allow people to ask for things over the phone or in person. I have since moved on and am attending another University that has assisted me in finding the right program, that fits my needs and will allow me to graduate in a third of the time that I would have graduated at the University of Moncton.

Acadia University,,,,nan,,,ChIJA-NGZkoioFMRgLZRZi8cwEo,"I'd like to provide some feedback based on my experience in ENGL108 under the instruction of Safia Ahmad at MacEwan University. Initially, I found the course guidance somewhat ambiguous, as the assignments were issued without supporting rubrics. Despite my previous academic successes (a BBA Honours degree from NAIT with a GPA of 3.92 and a BSc degree with Distinction from UofA with a GPA of 3.7), I struggled to meet the grading criteria, which were not clearly articulated.
During my entire academic journey, I have never previously encountered such low assignment grades without receiving appropriate explanation or constructive feedback. This led me to perceive a certain lack of clarity in Ms. Ahmad's communication with her students and a need for improvement in her organization skills.
Additionally, a series of quizzes we undertook were marred by various errors such as misspellings, incorrect answers, and issues with grammatical accuracy. I had to take the initiative to contact Ms. Ahmad on multiple occasions due to errors in the answer keys, which added an additional layer of frustration to my course experience.
I regret to say that I found the response from MacEwan University to my concerns regarding academic competence, course content, and grading, less than satisfactory. As a result of these experiences, I felt compelled to withdraw from the ENGL108 course under Ms. Ahmad's ""teaching"". However, I subsequently completed the course with another instructor and was pleased to achieve an 'A' grade.
In light of my experience, I would urge MacEwan University to review their hiring processes, specifically when recruiting from countries beyond the G7, where verifying qualifications can be more challenging. This is not to question the skills or experience of educators from these regions, but merely to ensure that the university continues to maintain its high standards of Canadian education.",Albert Cruz,1.0,,2023-06-22

Later in the day, the clouds descended and the fog gafe the campus an otherworldly feeling. The architecture of the original campus (circa 1960-70) is very nice even in the unfinished concrete grey. Lots of amazing angles for a photographer to explore.

It is nice that the the gymnasiums and aquatics Center are located in the same complex and attached to the visitor parking. These are easy to find not just on the map but also driving through campus.

To the east you have the main campus square, main library, and newest residences, as well as shopping area (with A&W, Starbucks, subway, TimHortons, Uncle Fahti‚Äôs and a few independent restaurants) There is also a large grocery store in the same strip.

To the west, you have the campy eatery, which boasts Buffett-style dining for breakfast lunch and dinner (at least on Sundays) Didn‚Äôt get to eat here but the price isn‚Äôt bad ($21.49) per adult).

I was at RMC for three years, you'll love the first year because of the solidarity in your squadron after the orientation program (FYOP) but starting in your third year especially you start to feel the effects of wear. The leadership system is inefficient and puts power-hunger teenagers in charge. You are put down if you're not a great athlete and especially if you fail the physical fitness requirements (even though they insist they'll help you pass them). The classes are mediocre and yield no credits if you choose to study elsewhere, so you've lost a couple of years of your time. The food is so horrible it's a running joke amongst students. Food is often moldy or rotten. And francophones are disadvantaged and forced to speak in English most of the time since most staff are not bilingual. What a bilingual institution!
Mental health is not addressed even though it is a very big issue at RMC. Suicides and attempts are hidden from the public and you only know about them if you know the person directly.

They made it seem as though is was an error on their end and the director would be crediting my account. On July 17th, the university then informed me that they would not refund nor provide a credit for my account due to their no refund on condensed course policy. The financial services director then sent me an email with a screenshot of the policy in very tiny writing. Upon discussion over the phonez the manager of financial services told me there's a chance I can get it back through backdating but I would have to jump through hoops and share my wifes personal medical information. At the end of the day I feel like they treated me like a number, took my money and had no care at all for my situation. They were not willing to compromise negating the fact that I am a first time customer at this university. Right now I will be looking to find another university to get accepted to in September.

Acadia University,,,,nan,,,ChIJV2eKonIjoFMRuu3TpLYsPF4,"As stated in other reviews, contacting Northern Alberta Institute of Technology and attempting to connect with an academic advisor has been an absolute nightmare. Despite our numerous calls and emails, the responses we received were nothing more than generic and unhelpful. Our specific inquiry regarding PLAR credits was met with a condition: in order to receive any substantial information, we were required to enroll and fully pay for a course. While I understand that PLAR assessments are conducted on a case-by-case basis, I firmly believe that direct communication with someone within the department would have provided me with enough information to make an informed decision.

NAIT's customer service in this regard was utterly disappointing. It was disheartening to encounter such a lack of responsiveness and willingness to assist. In stark contrast, Sask Poly offers outstanding academic advising services. Not only do they provide direct contact information for department representatives on their website, but they also excel at promptly addressing inquiries and providing the necessary guidance.

Based on my experiences, I would unquestionably choose to deal with Sask Poly over NAIT. Their commitment to accessibility and willingness to engage with prospective students sets them apart.

Acadia University,,,,nan,,,ChIJf674apob1YkR9RY3WRk6Nyo,"I went to this university for my first year and I was a forensic psychology major. I can't speak too much about other programs, and I'm not sure if everything I'll say can apply to later years. However, I can say a bit about engineering/stem (since I knew a good number of people majoring in those and I can recall what I heard from them) and social science and humanities since that's the faculty forensic psychology is in.

Pros:
-Environment: The people here are generally very friendly, including the professors and advisors: This was probably my first school year in a long time where I had no issues with any of my teachers whatsoever. The advisors were very friendly and helpful, along with the other staff such as the registrar office.

-It's a new school: some may see this as a problem but I think the school takes advantage of this well. A smaller school helps them to be more open and understanding of changes and areas of growth, so the school makes important changes rather quickly. They've also manages to develop connections with employers such as Tesla despite how new of an institution it is. I'm not too knowledgeable about their reputation with employers for social science and humanities though.

-leniency: this connects to my last point a bit, but the school is easy to reach and will listen to you. So, if you are a student who's struggling with mental health problems, your needs will be met. The professors are very understanding and willing to help, and you don't need to fight too hard for things like exam deferrals or extensions. I'm not sure if this applies to programs like engineering, but it definitely applies to social science and humanities.

-Quiet environment: If you don't like party schools you'll like this place.

-Campus: The north campus looks very nice and it isn't hard to get around the place. There are many residencies and place to eat nearby.

For engineering/stem: They have developed connections with employers in a short amount of time and there are many opportunities for networking.

Cons:
-location: It's in Oshawa, which is one of the ugliest and most boring places in all of Ontario. The north campus is fine and it has some nice places to eat nearby, but good God the downtown campus is awful. I seriously don't know why they chose to build a campus in the most ghetto part of the city. If you are taking anything in the social sciences, you'll have to commute (25 mins by bus) to the downtown campus often.

-leniency: I know I said this was a pro, but there is a downside to it. The school lets you get away with a bit too much. I felt that my classes were way too easy and the professors were lazy at times.

-social life: Most people who complain about this just need to realize that its possible to make friends anywhere; you just need to try. I will agree though that there aren't many events on campus, and there should be more variety in the clubs and societies. It is a commuter school, so most people just go home, and even people who live on campus go home over the weekends. Since it's close to a lot of cities, many people from the same high school go here, so you'll see that a lot of people know each other even on the orientation day. Otherwise, I think the lack of activities just makes living on campus boring. I wouldn't say that it's impossible to meet people, you just won't be given that many opportunities like other schools.

-Social science students get the short end of the stick: I noticed that social science students are more detached. Since a lot of classes are downtown, anyone who lives nearby simply just goes home. There are other things as well, such as how the engineering students have a whole floor in the residence building that is almost completely dedicated to them, and the stem students are overall able to network more easily because they are mostly together. Also, social science students don't have too much freedom when deciding the timings for their courses.

Overall, it isn't too bad of a school and it'll be even better in the future, but other schools are still a better option.",NoNomx15 Obtained,3.0,,2023-05-20

However, campus life for students is pretty much nonexistent.

This is probably the worse university in Ontario for campus life.  There is absolutely nothing that the campus offers the students.  Most of the resources that they say are available are way overbooked because the university has grown so quickly. I would caution any parents to not bother with residence or having your child live on campus‚Ä¶they are isolated and discouraged from meeting each other. For example, the only orientation activity they offered was a dance were students had to wear headphones and listen to the music in their ears. How crazy is that?

It seemed like half the classes were profs showing us YouTube videos or documentaries, which was hilariously ironic to me, as the profs were essentially highlighting the fact (knowingly or not) that their positions, as well as the entire university model are being made obsolete by the evolution of the internet and the multitude of FREE information and tutorials available to anyone there. I bought a camera in first year, watched YouTube videos to learn photography and editing, and started a side business that has been a thousand times better investment than my tuition, both monetarily and general enjoyment.

Acadia University,,,,nan,,,ChIJy5VZf3sEzkwRVEMDAWwa5zM,"The Universit√© du Qu√©bec en Outaouais (UQO) is a constituent university of the Universit√© du Qu√©bec system located in Gatineau, Quebec, Canada. As of September 2010, combined enrolment at UQO's Gatineau and Saint-J√©r√¥me campuses was 6,017, of which 4,738 were undergraduates and 1,279 postgraduate students. UQO offers more than 100 programs of study, including 30 master's and 5 doctoral programs.

It was named after Quebec's Outaouais region. Outaouais borders Ottawa and is part of the National Capital Region, where a large proportion of the population is bilingual.

The University was established in 1981 under the government of Ren√© L√©vesque (Parti Qu√©b√©cois), although university courses had been available in the region since 1971 (delivered by the Services universitaires dans l'Outaouais, or SUO).

Formerly known as the Universit√© du Qu√©bec √† Hull (UQAH), UQO changed its name in 2002 when the cities of Hull, Gatineau, Aylmer, Masson-Angers and Buckingham were amalgamated to form the new City of Gatineau. The University's new name reflects the administrative region of Outaouais, in which it is based.

About 5,500 students enrol in UQO courses each year. While this is the lowest enrolment in the Universit√© du Qu√©bec system, the number of students is steadily rising, creating demand for more courses, programs and resources. The academic staff comprises some 175 full-time professors and 565 lecturers.

In the past 25 years, UQO has granted close to 30,000 degrees. The University is also one of the main contributors to the qualified workforce in the region, along with Carleton University, University of Ottawa, La Cit√© coll√©giale, Algonquin College and the C√©gep de l'Outaouais.

UQO's Saint-J√©r√¥me campus was inaugurated on January 22, 2010, at a ceremony attended by Michelle Courchesne, Qu√©bec Minister of Education, Recreation and Sports, Jean Vaillancourt, Rector of UQO, Marc Gascon, Mayor of Saint-J√©r√¥me, Jacques Tanguay, President of Groupe AMT, and Sylvie Fr√©chette, Honorary Chair of the Fondation UQO fund-raising campaign. UQO | Campus de Saint-J√©r√¥me is housed in a 1,013 m2 (10,900 sq ft) building at the corner of rue Saint-Joseph and rue Labelle, opposite the town hall. Enrolment at the new satellite campus is close to 1,000. The six-storey main building includes classrooms, teaching and research laboratories, a library, an educational resource centre, office and administrative space, student lounges and ancillary services such as a cafeteria and bookstore. On completion of the 400-day construction project, supervised by Groupe AMT, the building was delivered to the University du Qu√©bec en Outaouais at a pre-tax cost of $21,750,000. UQO's project was modelled on the partnership used by the Universit√© du Qu√©bec √† Rimouski (UQAR) for its L√©vis campus, which was also built by Groupe commercial AMT under the direction of Jacques Tanguay. The building's architecture combines angles and curves to maximize the admission of natural light. On each floor is a windowed student work area. Staff members have access to a third-floor terrace that offers a view of Mount Royal on a clear day. The roof of this high-tech building features a solar wall that warms outside air before it is circulated indoors. The building, which will use 35% less energy than current Building Code standards, is awaiting LEED Silver certification. Groupe AMT will retain ownership for a period of 25 years, during which time it will be responsible for building management, maintenance and surveillance. The building will be transferred to UQO at the end of the 25-year lease. The Qu√©bec Ministry of Education, Recreation and Sports will provide an annual subsidy of $2.2 million over 25 years to cover the lease costs. This subsidy includes funding for construction costs and equipment acquisition for teaching spaces. The town of Saint-J√©r√¥me also made a generous contribution by donating the land on which the building stands, valued at $1.5 million.",tycoon kaiser khan,5.0,,2021-06-22

I was also charged $2,000 for a week-long summer course. Absolute robbery. Admin also forced me to stay on an extra semester to simply submit my final internship report so they ended up charging me an entire semester's tuition. Not to mention, I was told I had to enroll in and pass three pre-requisite intro-level courses before being admitted to the master's program because according to admin, I did not have enough credits from my Bachelor's degree.

I would then be asked to do everything online. I would have no problem doing things online if they did not use very old systems that do not work, or that will work on a on and off basis. This could easily be fixed if they did not force students to have to do everything on their old websites and would allow people to ask for things over the phone or in person.

Acadia University,,,,nan,,,ChIJCbDKp7I7K4gRoENk1gi7aIY,"I currently just finishing up my BBA in business from Guelph-Humber and thought i would leave a review and thoughts for those deciding where to go:

Guelph Humber is a small school (a bigger high school of 4500 students total in a sense). This is great since you will make friends in your classes as you have multiple of the same classes. People were friendly and easy to get along with. The only issue is that it is a commuter school and not much to do in the area hence most people go to class and go home after.

Administration was not the most helpful imo, although it depends who you got some were super helpful and others not so much. (Like any school)

The program was good but in my opinion it would be nice if there were more areas of emphasis that related to some courses. For example there was a data analytics class that I enjoyed but no more classes or area of emphasis for data analytics. Hence I'm applying to college certificate programs for that program.

Most professors are nice, approachable and you'll have the same professors in multiple classes and they get to know you by name. It's nice having a friendly face on campus to talk to when you bump into them in the hallway. But the school does rely heavily on sessional instructors meaning their are a few (not many) professors who may take awhile to get marks back or reply to emails since teaching is a priority just not their top priority.

The 100 hour co-op program is awesome to get experience but the school is small so there is not as many connections to industries as the bigger schools. Most (70%) of the internships are unpaid on the schools job board (although I imagine most schools co-ops are unpaid). Some students just ended up doing data entry or administrative services for free. While it is experience it may not be the most valuable experience imo. Although any experience is good experience.

Overall I did enjoy my time at GH and glad that I went. Feel free to DM me any questions, I'll be happy to answer them.

- Some profs in my program were absolutely amazing such as Ron Stansfeild, Laura MacDiamid, Nitin Deckha,  Danny O'Rourke, Jamie Killingsworth, Maria Iannuzziello, Aubrie Appel

Very flexible and understanding of your circumstances. I know we get a rep as a lame academic school that never parties, but it‚Äôs not true at all. Sure we may not be like Queens or Laurier where everyone parties hard all the time, but if you want to party when you go to university you WILL ALWAYS find people to party with. It is a bit more intense than some other schools, but you are paying for an education here so you want to get the most out of it as possible.

The people are also amazing and work to create a sense of belonging amount students. I made my best friends at Waterloo and we are now all living together.

Just to add a couple of things about the campus:
- huge campus with lots of study spaces and different facilities
- we have really good indoor bridges between building to keep you warm
- very lively, there are always events going on
- we are actually pretty good at sports and have a HUGE sports facility
- super close to tons of yummy restaurants
- A LOT of geese, and they do become aggressive in the spring
- actually a really gorgeous campus despite what you might believe
- Dana porter library can be so beautiful to study at when you‚Äôre on the 10th floor
- health services is right in the middle of campus and there is also a walk in clinic beside the uni
- they keep their campus very clean
- connected to the ion (train that connects uw to other places of the city)
- lots of grant and scholarship opportunities
- a lot of fun weird things just around campus like a museum, huge plant wall‚Ä¶
- lots of food options for people with dietary restrictions
- a super active student community that doesn‚Äôt make u cringe (check out club instagram pages)
- faculties steal each other‚Äôs mascots as a fun little game

Acadia University,,,,nan,,,ChIJq6ePeZCgHlMRJAyHny_D4Uc,"I think a lot of things need to be reevaluated at this university, but as we all know, change does not happen overnight. Focusing on the positives, over the past eleven years the university has been going through some kind of evolution.
There has been a lot of projects completed. The new residence towers, underground parkade and the new traffic signs took a while to build but they still got built. UofR renovated parking lots, and updated the university signs. They also removed the only on campus computer store probably because of operational costs.
A lot of programs got upgraded and the UofR is still working on ways to improve campus life. Despite getting hit with COVID-19 the university still found a way to deliver classes to the students who were willing to learn. Overall the UofR is doing a good job, but there is still room for improvement much like any other university.

On the student side of things, the UofR has had an influx in entitled spoiled brats attending school thinking they own the place just because they pay school fees. Not sure why but these students are always complaining about something! There is no self accountability it‚Äôs always some professors fault. It‚Äôs a miracle the professors do not kick some of the students out.

On the other hand, there are those hard working students who diligently study and participate in class. I am sure the university faculty appreciates them despite the complaining.

A lot of students complain about how hard university is, but then they are the first ones to procrastinate and not prepare for any classes.

The $100,000 price tag is not nearly worth your time. The core courses you take aren't very useful and the specialized courses are far too broad to take something home.
Their reaction to Covid was atrocious. They threw many students under the bus and did not provide half of the services they promised when we initially started. Also the ""Nintendo-Gate"" incident with my cohort was horribly handled. Stay away.
The administration openly admit you won't retain much of the information you will be provided which is really unfortunate given the Rotman reputation and price tag. Shameful show of education.

Acadia University,,,,nan,,,ChIJY4Z9jwGue0sRgrNgZM8klhE,"Corporate scammers. I got funded by the government to do the welding course. 4 weeks before the end of the course I had to have a life saving surgery where I got a vertical C-section, on my birthday, without ever having kids- very traumatic. When this tragedy happened I was paid in full for the year. They said that I could come back the next year to finish for free since I paid the whole year in full.

After I healed I tried to get right back in where I left off and by this point their tune had changed and they said I must have misunderstood and had to pay for the  course a second time. (Even though I paid in full already once and was not able to attend the last bit)

I had to contact a member of parliament to get funded again. The school makes a list of costs, I give that to the government, and the government sent them every dollar that the school requested, as per usual and normal.

The course ends, I graduate, everyone but me gets their certificate. I‚Äôm the only female in class.

I go to the college and they say I have to pay $50. I say that‚Äôs a mistake (government doesn‚Äôt make mistakes with money and I paid them everything the government gave) I said that I would pay it and accept a refund when they found the error in their systems.

Waited 2 months calling every day with no reply. Left countless messages with no reply. I Can‚Äôt register as an apprentice without the certificate and can‚Äôt work without registering.

When I went in they said I did not pay the $50  that I was expecting to have refunded and that I now owe $95!! I told her that‚Äôs impossible because I was funded, admin says the government never sent enough and I can‚Äôt have my certificate. They‚Äôd rather claim that I don‚Äôt understand than try to understand the issue themselves.

The only female in class- top of my class last year, they didn‚Äôt even honour that this year at the graduation. all means nothing.

On top of going through hell and back to get this, now I gotta make a ton of calls and complain and whatever else to get my certificate, something my MALE class mates don‚Äôt have to go through.

Acadia University,,,,nan,,,ChIJB5eDqmAayUwR9kVcpBmnMrc,"Reasons for ets being above average:

1)We learn assembly, not the most helpful of programming languages but it‚Äôs definitely a language.

2) We have security guards on segways so you know it‚Äôs safe.

3) With almost 10% of our students being of the female persuasion we can say that our diversity is of utmost importance.

4) We are all technically technicians, however some of us still have no idea what we are doing here.

5) if you do decide to come here please be aware that all exams are in French with absolutely no way of having them in English. Recruiters love to trick us English folk.

6) we have a pub; it‚Äôs food is mediocre but it serves alcoholic beverages which can help you get through some of the more ‚Äúexciting‚Äù classes.

7) the clubs are great even when they trap you in with a minimum requirement of 10-40 hours a week of involvement.

8) the cafeteria here has coffee though it tastes like dirty dishwasher at times.

9) it‚Äôs the university I chose so I guess that counts for something.

10) Teachers are so much more involved than at Concordia. The classes are capped at ~40 students.

The profs are good, classes are good, food is fine, res is good but the real reason i'm writing this review is because of the staff, not prof included. Let's call them the backbone of Ambrose. People like the cooks, admin, the calf ladies who scan your card, our custodial staff, maintenance and upkeep people, and security! These people go above and beyond. We have 24 hour security so when I leave my room at 2 O'clock I feel safe as I know there is a security guard close by. Heres a quick little story about the grounds up-keep people. Today I was sitting outside and I look up to see one of them  sweeping the road and getting rid of the dry grass. Its a little thing, the grass would have blown away and it wouldn't have really affected anything, but this man sweeps it up so it doesn't blow away.

-Resistance life was good despite there being a pandemic during my stay.
-As someone who‚Äôs a big eater the all you can eat meal plan was great although it got a little old by the end.
-All Brock services also works very seamlessly using the student card.

The bad:
-From my experience most of the professors I‚Äôve had were either lazy or simply didn‚Äôt care. In many instances I would simply ask a question and get scolded or laughed at for getting something wrong. I think the university should seriously consider a different hiring process because whatever they‚Äôre doing now isn‚Äôt working.
-Many times at Brock I was slammed with some hidden fee or some program that I was automatically opted into like healthcare or dental care. The school is also extremely stingy on giving any sort of refund.
-The online portal which you use for pretty much everything at Brock is outdated and confusing.
-The administrators and professors made my transfer process UNBEARABLE. It took me almost two months to get a few syllabi. Most staff either ignored my emails or directed me to someone who would ignore me.

Overall my experience at Brock was satisfactory at best. After transferring to a different university I realized just how bad Brock truly was. I would advise staying away from this university as there are plenty of better options in Ontario alone.",Graeme Bogie,2.0,,2023-07-26

For the remaining 1/3, I had to retort to online alternatives such a watching a video series of the same course, but for free on YouTube or Khan Academy to get a better sense of concepts. It doesn't make sense how those helped me understand more than the actual courses I paid a lot for. Even the textbooks explained concepts better than the professors could.

In total, l only failed two courses, which I had to retake in the Summer. I noticed that the professors of Summer classes tended to be more passionate and had better pacing, which helped me actually learn. It made me realize that some professors may be only hired based on their knowledge and not by the quality of their teaching.

I was present yesterday at BCIT downtown campus when a fellow classmate had a medical emergency. None of your security guards had first aid training, and when concerned they were having a heart attack they could not locate or tell us where the defibrillator was and looked for it for the entire time never locating it. If this was truly the case, the student could‚Äôve died. Your young female guard left the scene several times to run down to talk to the older man guard while she could‚Äôve used a radio to contact him and ensure she was with the injured student. When the ambulance finally arrived, I was told to go get them by the 911 operator. Upon doing so, your older man security guard yelled at me and another classmate. Telling us to go away, that this was not our job and to leave. All while the paramedics were asking for info on what happened, who my classmate was and age and condition. None of which he knew so I had to answer them as he continued to scream at me and my fellow student to go away.
We tried to access the students emergency contact to call a contact for the student, but no one from my teacher (not their fault) to the security could access this emergency contact info.
This is unacceptable behaviour from any school, let alone one of BCIT‚Äôs claimed excellence. On numerous occasions your reckless employees could‚Äôve caused a students death by being untrained, and if the students in my class were not trained in first aid the student could‚Äôve suffered further complications or risks.

I could go on, but I believe I have made my point. No employer will ever take you seriously with a degree from this ""university,"" so if you care about your future, I'd highly suggest looking elsewhere and if you just want parties, find some place less trashy.",Jack McDonald,1.0,,2023-05-05

Acadia University,,,,nan,,,ChIJ6aoUBVeX51IRdKPh4o7Wx54,"Brandon University is well known for being School of Music üéº. However, their Nursing and Geology faculties also have good reputation for guiding their students to path of success along with other faculties.
I have completed my Bachelor‚Äôs degree from this University. It is a great educational institution if you like small classes and want to meet your profs in person on short notice. Tuition fees here is affordable compared to big universities, so you won't go broke after graduation.
However, if you are an international student from a middle class family, I‚Äôll ask you to do your research before you get into this University. As Brandon University has adorable tuition fees, many middle class international student join here. However, in past years, i have noticed that University has a tendency to increase international students tuition feels dramatically. Two years later, your tuition feels might not stay anyways close to where it is now, so if you have a set budget for your education, give it a second thought. At the top of it, there is no manitoba health care for international students anymore. You might get stuck in the middle of your degree because of tuition increase, and not be able to transfer to other universities because no other universities usually get more affordable than BU.
Moreover, keep it in mind that Brandon is a very small city, so it has less room to develop and network which will a big disadvantage for you to get a good job after graduation. According to my experience, networking is the best friend of an international student as you‚Äôll be starting from the bottom in a new country.
Having said that, if you are a Canadian student, don‚Äôt worry about cones. Honestly, there is more pros than cons for you at this University.
I hope, this review helps you.
